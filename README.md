# VSFormatOnSave

Visual Studio plugin to automatically format document on save. Current release includes:
* RemoveAndSort: Same as Edit > IntelliSense > Remove and Sort Usings
* FormatDoucment: Same as Edit > Advance > Format Document
* UnifyLineBreak: Enforce line break to CRLF or LF.
* UnifyEndOfFile: Enforce only one line return at the end of file.
* TabToSpace: Convert tab to space.
* ForceUtf8WithBom: Force file encoding to UTF8 with BOM.
* File extension filters.
* Batch formatting in solution explorer.

I found it convenient to unify source code format throughout the develope team. If you have any suggestion, feel free to tell me.
